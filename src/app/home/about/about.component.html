          In our traditional healthcare system, finding treatment is often illness-focused and does not take into account all the elements of our wellbeing - mental, physical, social, emotional, and spiritual health. Instead, it only treats symptoms. PromptHealth was created to solve the gap between people seeking preventative care, and the wellness practitioners who provide complementary solutions to traditional healthcare. 
          <br><br>
          In a world where people seek health information online, we are enabling trusted practitioners to share their knowledge and resources to those seeking wellness solutions, all in one place. Our app acts as a social platform that allows users to find and learn from wellness providers in whatever media format they prefer, including notes, voices, events, and articles.

            At 16-years old, PromptHealth Founder and CEO Hedieh Safiyari immigrated to Canada from Iran. 
            Hedieh’s interest in health and wellness led to obtaining her undergrad in kinesiology at the University of British Columbia. 
            She went on to finish a master’s degree in cardiac rehab, and worked as a clinician in cardiac rehab for over 15 years at one of the pioneer companies of private healthcare in Canada. 
            After 20 years in the health and wellness industry, Hedieh knew there were gaps in the way people discovered care options, and wanted to do something about it. 
            In 2015, she pursued an executive MBA at SFU to learn how I could approach this issue. 
            After completing 2 years of consultancy work in the health and wellness industry, PromptHealth was launched in 2020. 
            Since then, the team has grown to over 10 people - all on the same mission to help people seeking care reach informed decisions about their health.
