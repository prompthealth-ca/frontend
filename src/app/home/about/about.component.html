          is an online platform revolutionizing the health and wellness experience. 
          It started off as a two-sided marketplace where people could personalize their search options and connect with different practitioner types proven to help with a specific cause. 
          Now, with the help of our network of practitioners and further technology development, PromptHealth is the go-to social app and site to provide people with the educational resources they need to make informed decisions about their health, in an engaging format. 
          PromptHealth acts as a ‘personal assistant’ that takes the challenge out of accessing and navigating the care you need. 
          Rather than assuming people know what their options are for care and leaving them to find one specific type of practitioner, PromptHealth analyzes the users health goal or concern to connect them with all accredited solutions for care. 
          Our mission is to help people seeking care reach informed decisions about their health by providing credible educational resources and personalized care options.

            At 16-years old, PromptHealth Founder and CEO Hedieh Safiyari immigrated to Canada from Iran. 
            Hedieh’s interest in health and wellness led to obtaining her undergrad in kinesiology at the University of British Columbia. 
            She went on to finish a master’s degree in cardiac rehab, and worked as a clinician in cardiac rehab for over 15 years at one of the pioneer companies of private healthcare in Canada. 
            After 20 years in the health and wellness industry, Hedieh knew there were gaps in the way people discovered care options, and wanted to do something about it. 
            In 2015, she pursued an executive MBA at SFU to learn how I could approach this issue. 
            After completing 2 years of consultancy work in the health and wellness industry, PromptHealth was launched in 2020. 
            Since then, the team has grown to over 10 people - all on the same mission to help people seeking care reach informed decisions about their health.
