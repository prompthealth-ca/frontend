It started off as a two-sided marketplace where people could personalize their search options and connect with different provider types proven to help with a specific cause. Now, with the help of our network of providers and further technology development, PromptHealth is on track to be the go-to social app and site to provide people with the educational resources they need to make informed decisions about their health, in an engaging format. PromptHealth acts as a ‘personal assistant’ that takes the challenge out of accessing and navigating the care you need.`,
